# üçï hello-pizza

**A tasty landing page, fresh out of HTML and CSS.**  
*(August 2025)*

### Welcome
Welcome to ***hello-pizza*** ‚Äî my first guided web project from [JavaScript Impressionador - M√≥dulo 8: Desenvolvimento Web](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/curso-javascript). It‚Äôs a small landing page for a pizza place, designed to be simple, clean, and fun.  

This project let me practice HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic layout techniques, all while following step-by-step guidance from the course. Even though it was guided, I still learned a lot about organizing content, styling elements, and making a page visually appealing.  

Creating ***hello-pizza*** was a tasty introduction to web development and a reminder that small exercises can teach big lessons.

### ‚ú® What‚Äôs inside
This project includes:  

- An HTML file ([`index.html`](index.html)) that:
  - Structures the page content semantically
  - Includes headings, sections, and a simple menu
  - Provides placeholders for images and links  

- A CSS file ([`style.css`](style.css)) that:
  - Styles colors, fonts, and layout
  - Implements basic responsive design
  - Adds a little pizzazz to headers and buttons  

Together, they form a simple but tasty landing page ‚Äî just enough to get a feel for web development while keeping it fun.

### Why it exists
This project was part of [JavaScript Impressionador - M√≥dulo 8: Desenvolvimento Web](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/curso-javascript), designed to help beginners explore HTML and CSS through a guided exercise. I wanted a playground to practice web fundamentals, and a pizza landing page was the perfect scenario to experiment.

### How it works
- Written in HTML and CSS  
- Fully static, no backend  
- Designed for desktop and mobile layouts  
- Teaches the fundamentals of structuring content and styling a webpage
