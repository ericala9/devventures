# 🧭 devventures

**A journey through learning, bugs, and accidental deploys.**

## From R to React: how I stumbled into the world of code

It all started in July 2025, when a family friend called me, slightly panicked — he needed a developer for a volunteer project I was already part of.

I'm a statistician, I code in R, and I work far away from anything web-related. I said I probably couldn’t help.

He replied: “That’s already enough!” and scheduled an interview with the dev team.

I went in thinking they’d turn me down. But the desperation was so real, they took me in.

And so began the devventures begin:

- I joined without knowing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript  
- Had never used GitHub Desktop  
- Didn’t know what a Pull Request was  
- Thought styled-components were a type of clothing
- I insalled VS Code in my brand new computer before I installed RStudio

But I studied. A lot.

Eleven weeks later, I delivered my first real card: sorting a table, with interactivity, controlled state, and React styling.

Before the deadline. With clean commits, well, commiting to main branch out of naivety. And a deploy (even if Vercel tried to troll me).

I don’t know if I’m a dev yet. But I do know that with the right people on my side, my devventures are being epic.

And if you think you don’t know enough to start… maybe you already have everything you need.

This is my sandbox of devventures — a place to collect:

- Course and tutorial projects  
- Experiments with new technologies  
- Small bugs that taught big lessons  
- And maybe, just maybe, a bit of style (even without styled-components)

Each folder is a chapter in this journey. Feel free to explore, clone, laugh, or contribute.
