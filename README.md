# 🧭 devventures

**A journey through learning, bugs, and accidental deploys.**

## From R to React: how I stumbled into the world of code

It all started in July 2025, when I got a call from an unknown, out-of-state number.

Turns out it was a slightly panicked family friend who needed a developer for a volunteer project I was already involved with.

I'm a statistician; I’ve been coding in R since 2009, and I work far away from anything web-related. I said I probably couldn’t help.

He replied, “That’s all we need!” — and scheduled an interview with the dev team.

I went in thinking they’d turn me down. But they didn’t.

Getting out of my comfort zone, I downloaded VS Code on my brand-new computer, which didn’t even have RStudio installed yet.

And so the devventures began:

- I joined without knowing what JavaScript was.
- Had only a vague idea of what CSS was.
- Didn’t know what a Pull Request was.
- Thought styled-components were a type of clothing.

But I studied. A lot.

Eleven weeks later, I delivered my first real feature: sorting a table — with interactivity, controlled state, and React styling.

All before the deadline, with clean commits (well… mostly — I was still committing directly to main out of pure naivety).

I don’t know if I’m a dev yet. But I do know that, with the right people on my side, my devventures are turning out to be epic.

And if you think you don’t know enough to start… maybe you already have everything you need.

## 📁 About this repository

This is my sandbox of devventures — a place to collect:

- Course and tutorial projects  
- Experiments with new technologies  
- Small bugs that taught big lessons  
- And maybe, just maybe, a bit of style (even without styled-components)

Each folder is a chapter in this journey — feel free to explore, clone, laugh, or contribute.
