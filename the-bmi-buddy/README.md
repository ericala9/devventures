**A quiet little page that turns numbers into a bit of info.**  
*(September 2025)*  

### Welcome  

Welcome to ***the-bmi-buddy*** ‚Äî my first web project using JavaScript. It‚Äôs a guided project from [JavaScript Impressionador - M√≥dulo 8: Desenvolvimento Web](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/curso-javascript), where I built a simple BMI calculator step by step while learning how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.

This calculator helps users understand their Body Mass Index (BMI), a basic measure that estimates healthy weight ranges based on height and weight.

### Along the way  

I followed the lessons closely but also tried a few small experiments on my own ‚Äî mostly in CSS, just to see what would happen. Not sure if I love the result yet, but it was definitely fun to build.

It turned out simple, functional, and maybe even a little kind. Along the way, I practiced DOM manipulation and learned how rewarding it can be to make something that actually works.

This project also sparked an idea for the future: maybe I‚Äôll create a pocket-like calculator for the web someday. Will I actually make it? No one knows.

### ‚ú® What‚Äôs inside  

This project includes:  

- An HTML file ([`index.html`](index.html)) that:  
  - Defines the calculator structure and layout  
  - Includes input fields, buttons, and a result area  

- A CSS file ([`style.css`](style.css)) that:  
  - Styles the calculator‚Äôs interface and adds gentle color contrasts  
  - Experiments with spacing, alignment, and a touch of personality  

- A JavaScript file ([`script.js`](script.js)) that:  
  - Calculates BMI based on user input  
  - Displays the result dynamically  
  - Provides gentle feedback without judgment  

Together, they form a small but complete project ‚Äî my first step into interactive web development.

### How it works  
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Fully static, runs directly in the browser

### About this space  
This project lives in my [`devventures`](../) sandbox ‚Äî a space for web experiments and learning projects. ***the-bmi-buddy*** is one of those milestones that remind me how every small project counts.
